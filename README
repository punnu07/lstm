data format as in lstm_data text file
each row is a time series
the format of the data is as follows

[[[[1,2,3],[0.2,0.8]],[[3,2,1],[0.9,0.1]],[[2,3.1,4.5],[0.4,0.6]]]
[[[1.1,2.2,3],[0.1,0.9]],[[13,12,13],[0.8,0.2]],[[1,3.1,4.5],[0.5,0.5]]]
[[[91,12,33],[0.4,0.6]],[[322,21,12],[0.9,0.1]],[[12,83.1,44.5],[0.2,0.8]]]]

call this by 
./lstm $data_file #number_xy_pairs, x_dim, y_dim
./lstm data 3 3 2
